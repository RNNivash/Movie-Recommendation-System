# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview
The **Movie Recommendation System** is designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences. It leverages machine learning techniques to analyze user behavior and movie features, providing personalized recommendations.

## 🔍 Features
- 📊 **Content-Based Filtering** – Recommends movies based on movie features (e.g., genre, director, cast).
- 🔗 **Collaborative Filtering** – Suggests movies based on user preferences and ratings.
- 🏆 **Hybrid Approach** – Combines both methods for improved accuracy.
- 📈 **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** – Handles missing values, feature extraction, and transformation.
- 🎭 **User Interface (Optional)** – Simple interface for entering preferences and receiving recommendations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python** – Programming language for model development.
- 📊 **Pandas, NumPy** – Data preprocessing and analysis.
- 🤖 **Scikit-Learn** – Machine learning model implementation.
- 🔥 **Surprise Library** – Collaborative filtering algorithms.
- 📊 **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization.

## 📂 Dataset
The project utilizes the **MovieLens dataset**, which contains user ratings and movie metadata (genres, year, etc.).

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RNNivash/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
   cd Movie-Recommendation-System
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the model:**
   ```bash
   python recommendation.py
   ```

## 📌 Usage
- Enter a movie title to get recommendations.
- Adjust parameters like similarity metrics for better results.

## 📝 Future Enhancements
- ✅ Implement deep learning models (e.g., Neural Collaborative Filtering).
- ✅ Add a web-based interface using Flask or Streamlit.
- ✅ Incorporate real-time recommendations.
